# Turing Yearbook: A Kanye-West-Inspired Adaptation 
## By Ann Cerveny

Turing Yearbook is page built using the Javascript React library, HTML, and CSS, and is a beginner's attempt to learn to manipulate components, JSX, and event handlers in React. It is the first project of Mod 3 for the 1904 Front-End Engineering Cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design. Our objective was to display data from both "Students" and "Staff" datasets and create functionality within the page to add a student via a controlled form, delete a student using the "Remove Student" button, and allow for editable content in the Student yearbook entries.

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Clone down this repo. Then, run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`, to initialize the React server.
